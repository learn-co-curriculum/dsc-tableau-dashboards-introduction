# Tableau Dashboards - Introduction

## Introduction
The most powerful feature of Tableau is the ability to create interactive _Dashboards_. A _Dashboard_ in Tableau is a collection of workbooks which have been formatted to convey information from data with multiple visualizations. The creator of a dashboard can add interactive objects to the visualizations to allow the viewer to change the views to understand various features of the data. In this lesson, we will explore the creation of a _Dashboard_ and look at the various objects Tableau offers to format the _Dashboard_ for effective communication of the data for the viewer.

## Objectives
You will be able to: 
* Understand the uses for a Dashboard
* Understand the objects of a Dashboard

## Why Create a Dashboard
In Tableau, workbooks are used to create visualizations and share them so the viewer can gain insight into some data. They are composed of worksheets which are spread across tabs and can be accessed one at a time making it difficult to compare one viz with another. A _Dashboard_ allows the creator to format the visualizations in a manner that allows for the user to see. The _Dashboard_ has multiple objects which can be customized to allow the viewer to interact with the data in order to ask their own questions of the data.

## Dashboard Objects
The dashboard has multiple components to allow you to create a customized platform for your data to be shared, these components are referred to as _Objects_ in Tableau. These objects allow you position vizes in the Dashboard and add other interactive components such as _web links_, _images_, and interactive filters just to name a few. All of these objects work together to make the Dashboard a useful tool to gain insight into a data set or data sets.

## Interactive Dashboard
Adding interactivity to a dashboard is a great tool to let your viewer adjust the view of the data to meet their need. One way you can add interactivity to a dashboard is to have a drop down menu of locations for the viewer to focus on. Upon selecting a location the vizes on the dashboard would automatically display the data relevant to that specific location. There are many other ways to add interactivity to the dashboards, and we will touch on those in the next lesson.

## Summary
In this introduction you were introduced to the Dashboard tool in Tableau. You learned why it is useful and about a few of the objects that help in the creation of the dashboard. In the next lesson, we will dive deeper into the dashboard and learn how to create a useful dashboard.
