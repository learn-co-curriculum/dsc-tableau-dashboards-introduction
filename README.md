# Tableau Dashboards - Introduction

## Introduction
The most powerful feature of Tableau is the ability to create interactive _Dashboards_. A __Dashboard__ in Tableau is a collection of views which have been formatted to convey information from data with multiple visualizations. The creator of a dashboard can add interactive objects to the visualizations to allow the viewer to change the views to understand various features of the data. In this lesson, we will introduce Tableau dashboards and look at the various functionality Tableau offers to format dashboards for effective communication of the data for the viewer.

## Objectives
You will be able to: 
* Explain use cases for a dashboard
* Identify and describe the components of the dashboard

## Why Create a Dashboard?
Up until this point, we have used Tableau workbooks to organize our worksheets which contain vizzes of particular views from our data source. This is a great start, but there is still room for improvment with respect to the end user experience. Flipping through tabs is not an efficient way to see the big picture from your data. We can level up the expression of our insights by creating a dashboard to aggregate our findings on related topics.

In previous lessons, we have described Measures and Dimensions as the building blocks of vizzes. Similarly, we can say that worksheets (and their vizzes!) are the building blocks of Tableau dashboards.
Strategically arraning key visualizations in a dashboard provides a space where we can ask deep questions of our data to gain insights. 


## Dashboard Objects
The dashboard has multiple components to allow you to create a customized platform for your data to be shared, these components are referred to as __Objects__ in Tableau. 

These objects allow you position vizes in the Dashboard and add other interactive components such as web links, images, and interactive filters just to name a few. All of these objects work together to make the Dashboard a useful tool to gain insight into a data set or data sets.

## Interactive Dashboards
Adding interactivity to a dashboard is a great tool to let your viewer adjust the view of the data to meet their need. 

One way you can add interactivity to a dashboard is to have a drop down menu of locations for the viewer to focus on. Upon selecting a location the vizes on the dashboard would automatically display the data relevant to that specific location. There are many other ways to add interactivity to the dashboards, and we will touch on those in the next lesson. Check out the example below:

</td></tr></table>

## Summary
In this introduction you were introduced to the Dashboard tool in Tableau. You learned why it is useful and about a few of the objects that help in the creation of the dashboard. 

In the coming lessons, we will use the workbook we created previously to build out an expressive dashboard in Tableau.
